You should write at least 250 words.


Some people believe that job satisfaction should be prioritised over job security, whereas others argue that it is unrealistic to expect fulfilment at work and that having a permanent job is more important. This essay will discuss both perspectives before presenting my own view.

On the one hand, job satisfaction plays a crucial role in an individual’s overall well-being. People who enjoy their work are more likely to feel motivated, productive, and engaged, which can lead to better performance and career advancement. Furthermore, spending a large portion of one’s life in an unsatisfying job can negatively affect mental health, leading to stress, burnout, and a poor work–life balance. From this perspective, choosing a career that aligns with personal interests and values can result in long-term happiness, even if the position does not offer complete stability. In rapidly evolving industries such as technology or creative fields, workers may prefer challenging and meaningful roles over the reassurance of lifelong employment.

On the other hand, many people argue that job security is more important, particularly in an uncertain economic climate. A permanent job provides financial stability, allowing individuals to meet essential needs such as housing, healthcare, and education. For those with family responsibilities, consistent income is often a necessity rather than a choice. Additionally, job satisfaction can fluctuate over time due to workload, management changes, or external pressures, making it unreliable as a primary career objective. From this viewpoint, a stable job offers peace of mind and long-term planning opportunities, even if the work itself is not always fulfilling.

In my opinion, while job security is undeniably important, job satisfaction should not be overlooked. Ideally, individuals should seek a balance between the two. However, if forced to choose, long-term dissatisfaction at work can be more damaging than moderate instability, provided basic financial needs are met. A secure but unfulfilling job may offer comfort, but it rarely leads to personal growth or genuine happiness.

In conclusion, both job satisfaction and job security are important considerations. While permanent employment ensures stability, meaningful and enjoyable work contributes more significantly to long-term fulfilment and quality of life.
