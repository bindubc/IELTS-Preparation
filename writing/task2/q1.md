Some people say that nowadays children have too much freedom. To what extent do you agree or disagree?


It is often argued that children today enjoy an excessive degree of freedom, which may have both positive and negative consequences. While I acknowledge that modern society grants youngsters more autonomy than previous generations, I partly disagree with the notion that this freedom is inherently harmful.

On one hand, greater freedom allows children to develop independence, creativity, and decision-making skills. For example, many parents now encourage their children to pursue hobbies of their choice rather than strictly adhering to a rigid academic path. This autonomy can foster self-confidence and help children discover their passions, which is essential in an increasingly competitive and dynamic world. Moreover, freedom in social interactions enables children to build interpersonal skills and learn responsibility through experience.

On the other hand, excessive freedom can sometimes lead to a lack of discipline or poor decision-making. For instance, unsupervised access to digital devices may expose children to inappropriate content or distractions, potentially affecting their education and social development. In such cases, guidance from parents or guardians remains crucial to ensure that freedom is balanced with structure and responsibility.

In conclusion, while it is true that children today have more freedom than before, I believe this is not necessarily a negative development. The key lies in providing an appropriate balance, where children can enjoy autonomy while still receiving guidance to help them make wise choices. Therefore, I only partly agree with the idea that modern children have “too much” freedom.
