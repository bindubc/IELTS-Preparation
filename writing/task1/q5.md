The bar chart compares the proportions of the world’s population living in India, China, the USA and Japan in 1950 and 2002, and presents projections for 2050.

Overall, China and India account for the largest shares of the global population throughout the period. However, China’s proportion shows a consistent decline and is expected to be overtaken by India by 2050. In contrast, the USA and Japan represent much smaller percentages, with Japan experiencing the most significant decrease.

In 1950, China was the most populous country, accounting for approximately 23% of the world’s population, while India followed at around 15%. The USA and Japan made up considerably smaller shares, at about 8% and 4% respectively.

By 2002, China’s proportion had fallen to roughly 20%, whereas India’s share increased to about 18%. During the same period, the USA experienced a slight decline to approximately 5%, and Japan’s figure dropped marginally to just under 5%.

Looking ahead to 2050, India is projected to become the largest contributor to the global population, with its share rising to around 18%. Conversely, China’s proportion is expected to decrease further to approximately 15%. The USA is forecast to remain relatively stable at about 5%, while Japan is predicted to have the smallest share, falling sharply to around 2%.
