The line graph compares the proportions of people living in urban areas in the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia between 1970 and 2020, with projections to 2040.

Overall, urbanisation increased in all four countries over the period. Malaysia had and is expected to maintain the highest percentage of urban residents, while Thailand remained the least urbanised throughout. Indonesia experienced the most rapid growth after 2000, whereas the Philippines showed some fluctuation.

In 1970, around 30% of the population in both the Philippines and Malaysia lived in cities, compared with about 18% in Thailand and roughly 13% in Indonesia. By 1990, the Philippines briefly overtook Malaysia, reaching just under 50%, while Malaysia stood at about 45%. However, Malaysia then rose sharply to approximately 70% in 2010 and is predicted to exceed 80% by 2040.

Indonesia’s urban population increased steadily from the lowest base, accelerating after 2000 to reach just over 50% in 2020, with forecasts of around 65% by 2040. The Philippines dipped slightly around 2000–2010 before recovering to the mid-50s by 2040. Thailand grew more slowly overall but is expected to reach about 50% urbanisation by 2040.
