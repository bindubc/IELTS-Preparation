The maps compare the layout of a bookstore in 2000 with its current design.

Overall, the bookstore has undergone substantial reorganisation, shifting from a space primarily dedicated to book displays to one that places greater emphasis on customer comfort. While the entrance, service desk, and the Travel and New Books sections have remained unchanged, several book categories have been relocated and a café with seating has been introduced.

In 2000, fiction books occupied the largest area, covering most of the upper part of the store and the right-hand side. Non-fiction was confined to the bottom-right corner, whereas the Art, Hobbies and Cookery section was centrally positioned. Near the entrance on the left were the Travel and New Books sections, situated beside the service desk.

At present, the internal layout has been redesigned to create a more welcoming atmosphere. Non-fiction now takes up the largest section along the right side of the bookstore, while fiction has been reduced in size and moved to the upper-right area. The Art, Hobbies and Cookery section has been relocated to the upper-left corner, behind the Travel section. Most notably, a café has been added in the bottom-right corner, accompanied by three tables with four chairs each in the centre of the store, providing customers with a space to sit and relax.

Overall, the bookstore has evolved into a more customer-oriented environment without altering its main structural features.

The map illustrates the layout of the bookstore between 2000 and the present. 

Overall, the layout of the bookstore in 2000 mainly focused on book collections, specifically fiction books. While the new layout plan of the bookstore focuses on customer comfort and relaxation by introducing a cafe and a sitting arrangement.  The new layout plan is unchanged with respect to Travel, New books, and service desk. 



In 2000, Fiction accounted for the largest space of the bookstore in the timeframe. Non-fiction books were located at the bottom right. The Art, Hobbies, and Cookery section was placed in the center of the bookstore. The Travel and new release books were located close to the entrance on the left, alongside the service desk. 

In contrast, the present layout emphasises on ambience and customer experience.  Non-fiction had the largest space in the bookstore. 3 tables with 4 chairs each were placed in the center of the bookstore. The new layout allocated space for cafe. The cafe is located beside tables, which made easily accessible to customers. The Art, Hobby, and Cookery sections were relocated adjacent to the Non-fiction and behind the Travel section. The Travel, NewRelease, and Service desk remained as is.
