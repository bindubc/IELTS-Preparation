The line graph compares the numbers of shop closures and new shop openings in a particular country between 2011 and 2018.

Overall, the number of newly opened shops declined substantially over the period, whereas shop closures fluctuated markedly, most notably with a dramatic fall in 2015. While openings exceeded closures at the beginning of the period, the reverse was true in the later years.

In 2011, around 8,500 new shops were opened, compared with approximately 6,500 closures. The figure for openings then dropped sharply to 4,000 in 2012, before rising moderately to about 5,000 in 2013 and 6,200 in 2014. Thereafter, the number fell again to 4,000 in 2015 and remained broadly stable in 2016 and 2017, at just over 4,000. By 2018, openings reached their lowest point, at roughly 3,000.

By contrast, shop closures showed considerable volatility. After a slight decline from 6,500 in 2011 to 6,000 in 2012, the number climbed to a peak of about 7,200 in 2013. This was followed by a modest fall to 6,500 in 2014, before closures plunged to just 500 in 2015. The figure then rebounded sharply to around 5,100 in 2016 and stabilised at approximately 5,000 to 5,200 in the final two years.
